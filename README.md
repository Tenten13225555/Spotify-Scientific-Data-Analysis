# Spotify-Scientific-Data-Analysis

Spotify is a digital music streaming service that provides users access to over 82 million songs, podcasts and audio books. The app was developed by Daniel Ek and Martin Lorenzton in 2006. This app has become a family name over the years and boasts over 457 million subscribers as of 2022, rivaling SoundCloud and Apple Music. 

Spotify measures the popularity of its' artists based on their monthly listeners and number of streams they receive on songs produced. These streams are then multipled by (0.003) and paid to artists as "Royalties", it is a modernized system of monetizing digital sales from traditional album sales (100 streams = 1 album). Ed Sheeran was Spotify's most streamed artist in 2019, however, the rank placements change rapidly depending on album relases, EP's, mixtapes and so forth!

Spotify is a perfect dataset to measure the popularity of songs against various music elements, across a large set of songs throughout the decades. This analysis can be used to demonstrate how peoples music tastes have been translated throughout the past two decades!

I will be creating an exploratory analysis by creating data visualizations and conducting statistical analyses to investigate the relationship between the use of non-traditional musical elements and the popularity of Spotify hits from 2000 to 2019.
